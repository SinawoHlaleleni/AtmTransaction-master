 <h4>Domain problem: ATM</h4>
 The atm transaction should keep the system simple since thereâ€™s fraud out there so my 
 <br>solution is that if we can keep simpler that it expected but, in the meantime, 
 <br>hide personal information. By not using any kind of card anymore now just do 
 <br>profile in the bank branch then go login into atm, do run your transactions 
 <br>without having card just your profile and the machine should not contain
  <br>a port for cards just a plain machine with buttons or even touch screen 
  <br>to access your transaction only. It will decrease the scam and fraud in banks. After your 
 <br> logins the transactions should show up/ show menu to select your option.


<h5>Sub-domain: ATM- transaction</h5> that will allow user to choose from the functions which are withdraw, 
<br>deposit and balance without entering or inserting any card.
 <br>This domain will contain those four functions in the atm transaction. 
 <br>It will tell you your balance and how much you want to withdraw and if the 
 <br>funds are insufficient will give you note, but firstly you will have to create logins to access your funds.
